# Feedback on Final

I like how you organized your project code into a class and collection of functions. It made some of the flow easier to read.  More documentation that explains "why" you're doing what you're doing along the way would have been helpful.  For example: "Filter the data to the US and UK because...."

In your data visualizations, when looking at something like "Age", it would have been more valuable to review the distribution of ages (histogram) rather than just the average age. Similarly, it would have been good to look at the breakdown between gender and treatment between the US and UK groups. These are the kinds of comparisons that will help you understand teh distribution and bias in your data. (-1 on Data Visualization)

You have functions defined for doing a logistic regression. Did you intend to use those?  I didn't see it in the notebook.

I'm not sure that your conclusion of "the US has more mental illness than UK" is a valid one.  In this dataset, there are more examples of US mental illness than UK, but I don't see any evidence that you're looking at this on a per capita basis.  You need to adjust / normalize for overall population to come to any kind of conclusion like that. I'm not seeing your project take advantage of the other variables available in your data.
